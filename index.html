			    Hard Disk Drives (HDD) and Solid State Drives (SSD) are both forms of storage for 
				computers.  They both store information differently and this webpage will go over the pros and cons of both, and help you decide which one is better for your lifestyle and needs!

			<p> 
			    Hard Disk Drives are more commonly used because they have the potential to hold gigantic amounts of data, and they are cheap to invest in.  
				However, they can be affected by magnets and are prone to corruption if any moving parts are damaged, so if a magnet were to be close enough to your HDD, it would destroy the data inside.
				An HDD has an actual disk inside of it and it reads information off of the disk. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Hard disk drives can suffer from what is known as fragmentation.  This is what happens when the 
				space on the hard disk begins to fill up and the large file's data is scattered throughout the disk.

		<h2>Solid State Drives</h2>

			<p>
			    Solid State Drives, or SSDs, are a newer forms of storage technology.  They boot up much faster than Hard Disk Drives due to there being no moving parts, 
				and they access information within the drive much faster.  
				Solid State Drives are not affected by magnets, so the data inside would be safe if one were to come near.  
				The downside of Solid State drives is that they are more expensive than hard disk drives, and they do not store as much data as a hard disk.  
			</p>
			<p>
				Solid state drives dont have the issue of becoming fragmented, because there is no physical read head.  This allows the data on the SSD to be stored anywhere
				and still be accessed at lightning fast speeds.  SSD's are also very quiet since there are no moving parts.
